# Iqalox v0.2 #

The second iteration of **Iqalox** development. This iteration
concentrates on improving conditional control flow operations
and separating string concatenation from addition operations.
This version also extends the language's standard library beyond
`print` function to at least include array manipulation methods.

## New features: ##
- [ ] ternary operator
- [ ] standard library for array manipulation
- [ ] string concatenation with `concat` standard library method

## Other changes: ##
- [ ] deprecate support for unused variables (warn at compile time)
- [ ] deprecate string concatenation with `+` operator (to be removed in v0.3)
