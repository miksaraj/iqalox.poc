/// The scope/slot/upvalue algorithm (`findLocal`/`resolveUpvalue`/

/// global machinery as any other name, by looking up the synthetic names
/// "self"/"super" -- a method's function context gets an implicit `self`
/// local at slot 0, and a class with a superclass gets a synthetic
/// `super` local in a scope wrapping all of its methods (mirroring `clox`

/// time). Falling through all the way to an unresolved global for either
/// name is exactly the "used outside a method" / "no superclass" error
/// case, since neither name can ever be a real user-declared identifier
/// (both are reserved keywords -- `var self = 1` doesn't parse).
///
/// Global declaration order doesn't matter for compile-time immutability

/// walks any bodies, so a function that references a global declared
/// later in the same file (ordinary, expected mutual-recursion style code)
/// still gets a fully-informed immutability check, not a guess. Nested
/// (non-top-level) declarations have no such ambiguity to begin with --
