This is the complete reference for Iqalox as implemented by `0.2` — a
compiler frontend (`compiler/`, F#) that compiles `.iqx` source to a
bytecode file, executed by a stack-based virtual machine (`vm/`, C++23).
It documents what the language **actually does today**, with runnable
examples and an explicit list of known limitations. `0.2` is, by design,
everything `0.1` had — same syntax, same semantics, same core language —
plus a large batch of additions (§4, §9, §11, §12, §13, and noted
throughout): vector indexing, lambdas, cons/list-comprehension vector
forms, vector-literal spread, an array-manipulation standard library, a
matrix standard library, `pub`/`mut` property visibility and mutability,
method `pub`/private visibility, and mixin (`with`)/trait (`trait`/`use`)
class composition. See `ROADMAP.md` for what's planned beyond this
milestone, `docs/PLAN-0.2.md` for the day-to-day `0.2` implementation
log, and `docs/PLAN-0.1.md`/`docs/PLAN-0.1-POC.md` for the earlier
versions' logs.

Every code sample below is valid Iqalox and, unless marked otherwise,
compiles and runs successfully via `compiler/src/Iqaloxc.fsproj` (or
`iqaloxc`, once built) piped into `vm/build/iqaloxvm`. Longer, complete
programs live under `langspec/examples/*.iqx` — this version's
active-target fixture set (see `langspec/README.md`); `0.1`'s own frozen
snapshot lives under `langspec/versions/0.1/examples/*.iqx`.
`scripts/conformance-test.sh` (`docs/PLAN-0.1.md` Phase 9), which used to
diff fixture output against `poc/` byte-for-byte, was retired during
`0.2` Phase 7 (`docs/PLAN-0.2.md`): decisions 8-11's breaking changes to
the object model mean `compiler/`+`vm/` can no longer run `poc/`-era
class fixtures at all, and the repository owner's explicit call was to
drop cross-implementation conformance testing entirely rather than
maintain it — pre-`1.0`, backward compatibility with an earlier version
isn't a goal.

## 1. Introduction and classification

Iqalox is Lox — the small teaching language from Bob Nystrom's *Crafting
Interpreters* — mutated and extended by the repository owner into a
personal language project. `0.2` builds directly on `0.1`'s compiler
frontend plus bytecode virtual machine (see `ROADMAP.md`'s architecture
note), adding real vector manipulation and a first, deliberately-scoped
pass at multiple-inheritance-style class composition.

Classifying `0.2` along the axes commonly used to describe programming
languages — all statements below describe this implementation as it
exists today, not a permanent commitment for later Iqalox versions:

- **Paradigm**: primarily **imperative/procedural**, with **class-based
  object orientation** (`class`, `extends`, `with`, `trait`/`use`, `self`,
  `super`) and a meaningful vein of **functional-language influence** —
  functions and lambdas are first-class values, closures capture their
  defining environment, list comprehensions and cons build vectors
  declaratively, and the pipe operator (`|>`) encourages composing calls
  left-to-right the way functional languages do. There is no logic- or
  constraint-programming aspect.
- **Typing discipline**: **dynamically typed**. There is no type
  declaration syntax anywhere in the grammar — variables, parameters, and
  properties hold whatever value is assigned, and type errors (e.g.
  `"a" + 1`) surface as runtime errors, not at compile time. Within that,
  Iqalox leans **strong**: operators check operand types and raise a
  runtime error rather than silently coercing between them (no
  string-to-number or number-to-string coercion happens for `+`, `-`,
  `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, or the comparison operators).
- **Memory management**: fully **automatic**, via a real **mark-sweep
  tracing garbage collector** built into the VM (`vm/src/vm.cpp`), which
  allocates and traces every heap object (strings, vectors, functions,
  closures, classes, instances) itself. There is no manual memory
  management, no pointers, and no language-level concept of ownership or
  lifetimes exposed to Iqalox source code.
- **Execution model**: **ahead-of-time compiled to bytecode, then
  interpreted by a stack-based virtual machine** — source is scanned,
  parsed into an AST (`compiler/src/Ast.fs`), resolved into a bound tree
  with every binding/scope/slot already determined
  (`compiler/src/Bound.fs`), and lowered to a structured bytecode format
  (`compiler/src/Bytecode.fs`, `compiler/src/Codegen.fs`) that the VM
  (`vm/src/vm.cpp`) loads and executes via a fetch-decode-execute loop
  over an explicit value stack and call-frame stack. There is no
  tree-walking, no JIT, and no further optimization pass on the bytecode
  itself. **New for `0.2`**: every program is compiled together with a
  small prelude of standard-library functions written in Iqalox itself
  (`compiler/src/Prelude.fs`, see [§13](#13-the-standard-library)) —
  textually merged with the user's own source before resolution, not a
  separate module or import mechanism.
- **Evaluation strategy**: **eager (strict)** evaluation everywhere except
  the short-circuiting operators — `and`/`or`, `??`, and the
  ternary/elvis forms — which compile to conditional jumps rather than
  always evaluating every operand (see [§5](#5-operators-and-precedence),
  [§6](#6-control-flow)). Function and lambda arguments are fully
  evaluated before a call executes (**call-by-value** for the argument
  slots themselves; since the values passed may be references to heap
  objects, mutable values like vectors are shared by reference).
- **Scoping**: **lexical (static) scoping**, resolved entirely at compile
  time. `compiler/src/Resolver.fs` assigns every local variable a fixed
  stack slot and every non-local reference an upvalue, following the same
  scope/slot/upvalue algorithm as `clox` (*Crafting Interpreters*); the VM
  never does a name-based environment lookup at runtime for locals.
  Closures (both named functions and lambdas) capture the variables
  active at the point they're *declared*, not where they're *called* —
  implemented as `ObjUpvalue`s that point directly at a stack slot until
  that slot goes out of scope, then hold a closed-over copy. `super`
  resolution is **lexical** — it resolves to the class the calling method
  is *written in*, never to the calling instance's actual runtime class
  (see [§11](#11-classes-and-objects)); mixin composition (`with`) does
  **not** extend `super`'s chain at all (see
  [§12](#12-mixins-and-traits)).
- **Name-binding / mutability default**: **immutable by default**,
  enforced at **compile time** for local variables and function/lambda
  parameters — `var x = 1` followed by `x = 2` is a compile-time error;
  `var x mut = 1` opts in to reassignment. **New for `0.2`**: object
  properties now have their own, separate mutability model — a property
  is declared once, in the class body, as `var name`, `var name mut`,
  `var name pub`, or `var name pub mut` (no initializer expression; see
  [§11](#11-classes-and-objects)). Without `mut`, a property may be
  assigned **at most once** (typically inside `init`) — a second
  assignment is a runtime error, the property-level equivalent of local
  variables' compile-time immutability check, but necessarily a runtime
  one since which assignment is "the first" can depend on control flow.
  This replaces `0.1`'s model, where fields sprang into existence on
  first assignment with no immutability concept and no declaration
  requirement at all (see [§15](#15-known-limitations)).
- **Object model**: **class-based** (not prototype-based), with **single
  inheritance** via `extends`, plus, **new for `0.2`**, two additional
  composition mechanisms: **traits** (`trait`/`use`, PHP-style static
  copying of a trait's members into a class at compile time — a trait has
  no runtime representation of its own) and **mixins** (`with`,
  Scala-style composition of a real class's already-compiled
  methods/properties at runtime, via a dedicated `Mixin` opcode). Method
  dispatch remains **nominal** — a call resolves against the instance's
  actual runtime class (`ObjClass`'s `methods`/`publicMethods` maps,
  populated by copying superclass and mixin members in at
  `extends`/`with`-time), with no structural/duck-typed interface
  concept. **New for `0.2`**: declared properties and methods now carry
  **visibility** (`pub`/private) — see [§11](#11-classes-and-objects) for
  the full internal-vs-external access model, including the
  protected-like treatment of a subclass's own methods. The built-in
  value types (numbers, strings, booleans) remain plain values with no
  methods of their own — there's no `"hello".length()`-style access on
  primitives — but vectors are no longer purely literal-only data:
  indexing (`v[i]`), a growing set of array-manipulation functions, and a
  small matrix-manipulation library now operate on them (all as ordinary
  global functions, not vector methods — see
  [§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread) and
  [§13](#13-the-standard-library)).
- **Concurrency model**: **none**. Iqalox is single-threaded with no
  concurrency primitives, no `async`/`await`, and no scheduling model of
  any kind at this stage.
- **Error-handling model**: internally, the compiler front-end
  accumulates scan/parse/resolve/codegen errors as data (not
  exceptions), and the VM signals runtime faults via a C++ exception
  (`RuntimeError`) caught once at the top of `main`, but **none of this
  is exposed to Iqalox source code** — there is no `try`/`catch`/`throw`
  construct. A runtime error anywhere aborts the whole program (see
  [§14](#14-errors)).
- **Metaprogramming/reflection**: **none**. No `eval`, no reflection API,
  no macros.
- **Call syntax**: the standout, deliberately unusual axis for this
  language — see [§8](#8-the-call-syntax-no-parentheses). No function
  call, builtin or user-defined, takes parentheses; calls are formed by
  **fixed-arity juxtaposition** (`f x`, `f x, y`) reminiscent of
  ML-family languages, but *without* currying or partial application — a
  call's arity is fixed by the callee's declaration, not inferred from
  how many arguments happen to be written. **New for `0.2`**: postfix
  indexing (`v[0]`) is told apart from a paren-free call whose sole
  argument is a vector literal (`f [0]`) purely by **whitespace** — a `[`
  with no space before it is always indexing, a `[` with a space is
  always the pre-existing call form. This is the only place whitespace is
  significant anywhere in Iqalox's grammar (`langspec/SYNTAX_GRAMMAR.md`).
- **Syntax style**: brace-delimited blocks (`{ ... }`, not
  indentation-sensitive) combined with **implicit statement termination**
  on a newline (à la Python/JavaScript ASI) — either a real `;` or a
  newline ends a statement. Comments come in a shell-style line form
  (`# ...`) and a Pascal/ML-style block form (`<# ... #>`), not C-style
  (`//`, `/* */`).

## 2. Lexical structure

```
NUMBER      → DIGIT+ ( "." DIGIT+ )?
STRING      → '"' <any char except '"'>* '"' | "'" <any char except "'">* "'"
IDENTIFIER  → ALPHA ( ALPHA | DIGIT )*
ALPHA       → 'a'...'z' | 'A'...'Z' | '_'
DIGIT       → '0'...'9'
```

- **Numbers** are always floating-point — there is no separate integer
  type (`5` and `5.0` are the same value). Printing drops a trailing
  `.0`, so `print 5` prints `5`, not `5.0` (see
  [§13](#13-the-standard-library)).
- **Strings** may use single or double quotes interchangeably. Escape
  sequences are processed inside string literals — `\n` `\t` `\r` `\\`
  `\'` `\"` `\0` are recognized; any other character after a backslash is
  a compile-time scan error.
- **Comments**: `# ...` runs to end of line; `<# ... #>` is a block
  comment and may span multiple lines. Neither nests.
- **Implicit semicolons**: a newline is scanned as a statement
  terminator, exactly like a literal `;`. A blank line (or a
  comment-only line) becomes a harmless empty statement, not an error.
  The scanner turns *every* newline into an implicit `;` unconditionally,
  with no awareness of bracket/paren depth — see
  [§15](#15-known-limitations) item 9 for the resulting limitation on
  multi-line vector literals and grouping expressions.
- **Keywords** (cannot be used as identifiers): `and`, `class`, `false`,
  `fun`, `for`, `nil`, `or`, `return`, `super`, `self`, `true`, `var`,
  `extends`, `break`, `continue`, `mut`, `pub`, `with`, `trait`, `use`.
  (`module` is still reserved for future module support but has no
  grammar or meaning yet.) `print` and `concat`, and the whole
  array/matrix standard library (`push`, `pop`, `length`, `reverse`,
  `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, `transpose`, `multiply`, `add`,
  `subtract`, `elementwise`), are **not** keywords — see
  [§13](#13-the-standard-library).

## 3. Values and types

Iqalox has five kinds of user-visible runtime value:

| Type | Literal syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Number (always float) | digits, optional decimal point | `42`, `3.14` |
| String | single- or double-quoted | `"hi"`, `'hi'` |
| Boolean | `true` / `false` | `true` |
| `nil` | `nil` | `nil` |
| Vector | `[ ... ]`, comma-separated, cons, comprehension, or spread | `[1, 2, "three"]` |

Plus two callable/object kinds introduced by functions and classes:
function values (user-defined, lambdas, or native builtins) and class
instances — see [§7](#7-functions-closures-and-lambdas) and
[§11](#11-classes-and-objects).

There is also an internal `undef` value (distinct from `nil`), used to
mark a mutable local variable, or a non-`mut` property, that hasn't been
assigned yet. It is never actually observable in a running program —
every read checks for `undef` first and raises a runtime error
immediately, so it can't be printed, compared, passed to a function, or
stored anywhere (see [§4](#4-variables-and-mutability),
[§11](#11-classes-and-objects)).

**Truthiness**: only `nil` and `false` are falsy. Every other value —
`0`, `""` (empty string), and `[]` (empty vector) included — is truthy:

```
print (0 ? "truthy" : "falsy")     # truthy
print ("" ? "truthy" : "falsy")    # truthy
print (nil ? "truthy" : "falsy")   # falsy
```

**Equality** (`==`/`!=`) compares values directly and never raises —
comparing a number to a string, for instance, is a well-defined `false`,
not an error. **Ordering** comparisons (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) and
**arithmetic** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`) require both operands to be
numbers and raise a runtime error otherwise — there is no string
comparison or string `+` concatenation (use `concat`,
[§13](#13-the-standard-library)).

**New for `0.2`**: vectors are no longer literals-only data. `[1, 2, 3]`
still produces a value the same way it always has, but that value now
supports **indexing** (read and write), **cons** and **list-comprehension**
literal forms, **spread** inside an ordinary literal, and a real
array/matrix **standard library** — see
[§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread) and
[§13](#13-the-standard-library) for the full details. A matrix is not a
distinct type: it's simply a vector of vectors, indexed one level at a
time (`matrix[row][col]`) — see [§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread).

## 4. Variables and mutability

```
var x = 1          # immutable -- must be initialized
var y mut = 1      # mutable -- may be reassigned
y = 2              # OK
x = 2              # compile-time error: 'x' is immutable
var z mut          # OK -- mutable declarations may omit the initializer,
                    # but z starts as undef, not nil (see below)
```

An immutable (`var x`, no `mut`) local declaration **must** have an
initializer — `var x` with no `mut` and no `= ...` is a compile-time
error, since there would be no way to ever give it a value. A mutable
declaration may omit the initializer, in which case the variable starts
as `undef`.

Reassigning a local variable that wasn't declared `mut` is caught at
**compile time** — `compiler/src/Resolver.fs` tracks each binding's
mutability and reports an error before any bytecode is even generated.
Function and lambda parameters are immutable inside the body by the same
rule, with no per-parameter `mut` syntax to opt out.

Reading a mutable local variable before it's ever been assigned (`var z
mut` then using `z` with no assignment in between) is a **runtime**
error — `undef` is a distinct value from `nil`, and every variable read
checks for it first. This is deliberately a runtime check, not a
compile-time one: unlike immutability (which depends only on static
structure — was there an initializer, is there a later assignment), a
`var mut` binding's assignedness can depend on control flow the resolver
doesn't model (e.g. a variable assigned inside one branch of a ternary
but not another).

**Object properties (`self.x`) follow a related but distinct model, new
for `0.2`.** Unlike `0.1`, where fields sprang into existence on first
assignment with no declaration and no immutability concept at all, every
property a class uses must now be **declared** in the class body:

```
class Counter {
    var count mut   # declared, private, mutable
    ...
}
```

A property declared **without** `mut` may be assigned **at most once**
externally-invisible internal state is exactly what backs `init`-only
initialization — assigning it a second time is a **runtime** error (the
same `undef`-sentinel mechanism `var mut` locals use for
must-assign-before-read, reused here for write-once instead). A property
declared **with** `mut` may be reassigned freely, the same as a `var mut`
local. See [§11](#11-classes-and-objects) for the full property model,
including the separate `pub` visibility axis (whether a property is even
*readable*/*writable* from outside the class at all) and how the two
combine.

## 5. Operators and precedence

From loosest-binding to tightest (see
[§16](#16-grammar-and-precedence-reference) for the full grammar, and the
root `README.md` for the same chain presented tightest-first):

| Operator(s) | Meaning | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `=` | assignment | right-associative; also assigns through a trailing `[i]` index (see [§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread)) |
| `\|>` | pipe | desugars to a call, see [§10](#10-the-pipe-operator) |
| `,` | comma | left-associative, sequences expressions |
| `? :` / `?:` | ternary / elvis | see [§6](#6-control-flow) |
| `??` | null-coalescing | `a ?? b` is `a` unless `a` is `nil`, else `b` |
| `or` | logical or | short-circuits |
| `and` | logical and | short-circuits |
| `==` `!=` | equality | never raises |
| `>` `>=` `<` `<=` | comparison | numbers only |
| `-` `+` | additive | numbers only, no string concat |
| `/` `*` `%` `^` | multiplicative | includes modulo and power, numbers only |
| `++` `--` | prefix increment/decrement | mutating, target must be a variable |
| `!` `-` | unary not / negate | |

```
print (1 + 2 * 3)      # 7
print (2 ^ 10)         # 1024
print (7 % 3)          # 1
print (nil ?? "fallback")   # fallback
print (!false)         # true

var x mut = 1
print (++x)            # 2 -- mutates x and evaluates to the new value
print (--x)            # 1
```

Every short-circuiting operator here (`??`, `and`, `or`, ternary/elvis)
compiles to a conditional jump in the emitted bytecode — the right-hand
side's bytecode is only reached, and thus only ever executed, when it's
actually needed. Elvis (`a ?: b`) in particular evaluates its condition
exactly once even though it's also the "then" value, via a jump that
reuses the already-computed value rather than emitting the condition's
bytecode twice.

**New syntax that is not part of this table.** This table (and the root
`README.md`'s copy of it) covers infix/prefix *operators* specifically —
it has never listed member access (`.`), since that's postfix call-chain
syntax rather than an operator with a precedence level relative to the
others. `0.2` adds more syntax in that same postfix/structural category,
which for the same reason doesn't appear as a table row either:
**indexing** (`v[i]`) chains onto a call exactly like `.` does and binds
tighter than any operator above it; **lambdas** (`(params) -> expr`),
**cons** (`[item | list]`), **list comprehensions**
(`[expr | x <- xs]`), and **vector-literal spread** (`[...v]`) are all
literal/primary-expression forms, not operators applied to an existing
expression — see [§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread)
for indexing/cons/comprehension/spread and
[§7](#7-functions-closures-and-lambdas) for lambdas.

## 6. Control flow

**There is no `if`/`else` statement and no `while` loop.** Both are
deliberately absent from the language; `while` was removed outright.

The chainable ternary operator replaces `if`/`else` entirely, including
for statement-like branches (side-effecting calls, `break`, `continue`):

```
var category = (n < 0) ? "negative" : (n == 0) ? "zero" : "positive"

for (var i mut = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    (i == 3) ? continue : (i == 7) ? break : print i
}
```

`?:` is the **elvis** short form: `a ?: b` means "`a` if `a` is truthy,
else `b`" — it reuses the condition as the "then" value instead of
writing it twice:

```
var name mut = false
print (name ?: "anonymous")   # anonymous
name = "Waddles"
print (name ?: "anonymous")   # Waddles
```

`break` and `continue` are **expressions**, not statements — they're
parsed the same way `_` (see below) is, which is exactly what makes them
legal ternary branches. Each compiles to a jump out of (`break`) or back
to the top of (`continue`) the nearest enclosing `for` loop's bytecode;
using either outside of a loop is reported as a compile-time codegen
error rather than crashing anything.

`for` is the only loop construct, with the full three-clause C-style
form, every clause optional:

```
for (var i mut = 0; i < 5; ++i) { print i; }
for (;;) { break; }   # infinite loop, only escape is a break somewhere inside
```

The **ignore operator** `_` is an expression that evaluates to `nil` with
no side effect — useful as an explicit "do nothing" ternary branch:

```
var flag = true
flag ? _ : print "only prints when flag is false"
```

## 7. Functions, closures, and lambdas

```
fun add(a, b) { return a + b; }
var result = add 1, 2   # 3
```

Functions are first-class values. A bare function name with nothing
recognizable as an argument after it is a *reference* to the function,
not a call — this is what lets functions be passed around:

```
fun makeFive() { return 5; }
fun apply(func) { return func(); }   # explicit () -- see §8
print (apply makeFive)               # 5
```

Closures capture their **defining** environment, and that capture is
live (mutations to captured `mut` variables are visible across calls) —
the VM implements this with `ObjUpvalue`, which points directly at the
variable's stack slot for as long as that slot is live, then transitions
to holding a closed-over copy once the enclosing call returns:

```
fun createCounter() {
    var c mut = 0
    fun counter() { c = c + 1; return c; }
    return counter
}
var count = createCounter()
print count()   # 1
print count()   # 2
```

Recursion works via the normal name-binding mechanism (a function's own
name is bound in its enclosing scope before its body runs):

```
fun fact(n) { return (n == 1) ? n : (n * fact (n - 1)); }
print (fact 5)   # 120
```

A function called with the wrong number of arguments, or a non-callable
value called at all, is a runtime error.

**New for `0.2`: lambdas.** `(params) -> expr` is an anonymous function
value — a single expression body (no `{ ... }`, no `return`), otherwise a
closure exactly like any `fun`:

```
var double = (x) -> x * 2
print (double 21)         # 42

var makeAdder = (n) -> (x) -> x + n   # lambdas can return lambdas
var addFive = makeAdder 5
print (addFive 10)        # 15
```

A parenthesized parameter list is only read as a lambda's parameters if
the very next token after the closing `)` is `->` — otherwise the same
`(a, b)` shape is an ordinary grouped/comma expression (see
[§5](#5-operators-and-precedence)'s comma row). This is resolved by
lookahead **past** the closing paren, not by any other syntactic marker:

```
var pair = (1, 2)          # comma expression: evaluates to 2
var addPair = (a, b) -> a + b   # lambda: the -> disambiguates it
```

Lambdas are used throughout `0.2`'s standard library — `map`, `filter`,
`reduce`, and `sort` (see [§13](#13-the-standard-library)) all take a
lambda as their first argument.

## 8. The call syntax (no parentheses)

This is Iqalox's most distinctive departure from Lox (and from most
C-family languages): **no function call — builtin or user-defined — ever
takes parentheses to mark its argument list.** This was a deliberate,
non-negotiable design decision, not an oversight.

- **A single simple argument needs nothing**: `add5 1`, `Duck "Waddles"`,
  `math.square 3`.
- **Multiple arguments are comma-separated, with no wrapping parens**:
  `ifEqualOr 2, 5`. That comma is an argument separator, not the general
  comma operator (the same way the comma operator is suppressed inside a
  `[...]` vector literal).
- **A compound (non-primary) argument needs grouping parens** to mark
  where it ends: `fact (n - 1)`. Without the parens, `fact n - 1` would
  parse as `fact n` (a call) minus `1` — a binary subtraction, not one
  argument.
- **Zero-argument calls keep explicit `()`**: `count()`, `duck.quack()`.
  This is what lets a bare name mean "the function value itself" —
  without it, there'd be no way to distinguish "call `count` with no
  arguments" from "refer to `count` without calling it."
- **Nested calls need no extra parens**, because a fully-parsed call is
  itself just another primary value: `print concat [1, 2]` parses as
  `print(concat([1, 2]))`, with `concat [1, 2]` recognized as one complete
  call that becomes `print`'s single argument.
- Parentheses are **still used** for: grouping a compound argument
  (above), the explicit zero-arg marker (above), function
  *declarations'* parameter lists (`fun f(a, b) { ... }` is unchanged),
  and, **new for `0.2`**, lambda parameter lists (`(a, b) -> ...`, see
  [§7](#7-functions-closures-and-lambdas)) — only *call sites* lost their
  parentheses.

`print` and `concat`, and every array/matrix stdlib function, are
ordinary functions under this same grammar (see
[§13](#13-the-standard-library)) — there's no special
`printStmt`/`concatStmt` grammar rule the way Lox has a dedicated `print`
statement.

**Known ambiguity**: chaining `.method()` directly onto a call that
itself takes an argument binds to the argument, not the outer call — see
[§15](#15-known-limitations).

**New for `0.2`: indexing shares call syntax's paren-free juxtaposition
space, disambiguated by whitespace.** `v[0]` (no space before `[`) reads
as postfix indexing on `v`; `f [0]` (a space before `[`) reads as the
pre-existing call form — `f` called with the vector literal `[0]` as its
sole argument, exactly as `concat [1, 2]` above already does. This is the
only place whitespace is significant anywhere in Iqalox's grammar — see
[§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread).

## 9. Vectors: indexing, cons, comprehensions, and spread

`0.1`'s vectors were literals only — `[1, 2, 3]` produced a value with no
way to read an element back out, mutate it, or build one up
programmatically. `0.2` adds all of that.

### Indexing

```
var v = [10, 20, 30]
print v[0]        # 10
print v[2]        # 30

v[1] = 99
print v[1]        # 99
```

- 0-based, **bounds-checked** — reading or writing past either end of the
  vector is a runtime error (`Vector index N out of range.`), not
  silently `nil` or a resize.
- Indexing composes with anything that produces a vector, including a
  call's own result, and nests for matrix-style access:

```
fun makeVector() { return [1, 2, 3]; }
print makeVector()[0]   # 1

var grid = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
print grid[0][1]        # 2
grid[1][0] = 100
print grid[1][0]        # 100
```

A matrix is not a distinct type — it's simply a vector of vectors,
indexed one level at a time. See [§13](#13-the-standard-library) for the
matrix-manipulation standard library that operates on this shape.

- **As an assignment target**, `v[i] = x` follows the same parsing
  pattern `self.x = value` already uses: parse an ordinary indexing
  *read*, then peel the trailing `[expr]` off specifically when it's
  immediately followed by `=`, and treat that step as the mutable
  target — not a general "any expression is assignable" rule.
  `langspec/SYNTAX_GRAMMAR.md`'s `assignment` production has the exact
  grammar.

**New for `0.3`: negative indices.** `v[-1]` reads (or writes) the last
element, `v[-2]` the second-to-last, and so on — a negative index needed
no new grammar at all, since `-1` already parses as an ordinary unary-minus
expression; only the runtime bounds check changed, to accept `-length..-1`
as valid (translated internally to `length + index`) alongside the
existing `0..length-1`:

```
var v = [10, 20, 30]
print v[-1]   # 30
v[-1] = 99
print v[-1]   # 99
```

An index outside `-length..length-1` either direction is still the same
"Vector index N out of range" runtime error as before.

### Slices

**New for `0.3`.** `v[a:b]` returns a **new** vector containing the
elements from index `a` through index `b`, **inclusive** of both ends —
unlike many other languages' half-open slices. Either bound may be
omitted (`v[:3]`, `v[2:]`, `v[:]`), defaulting to the start/end of the
vector respectively; either bound may be negative, using the same
from-the-end convention as single-index access:

```
var v = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print v[1:3]    # [20, 30, 40] -- inclusive of index 3
print v[:2]     # [10, 20, 30]
print v[3:]     # [40, 50]
print v[:]      # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] -- a full copy
print v[-2:-1]  # [40, 50]
```

Unlike single-index access, a slice is deliberately more lenient: an
out-of-range bound **clamps** into the vector's own extent rather than
raising a runtime error, and a `start` that resolves after `stop`
produces an **empty vector** rather than an error:

```
print v[0:100]  # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] -- clamped, not an error
print v[3:1]    # [] -- start after stop, not an error
```

A slice always allocates a fresh vector — mutating the result never
mutates the source it was sliced from. There is no slice-assignment in
`0.3` (`v[a:b] = ...` is a parse error); slices are read-only this
version.

### Cons and list comprehensions

```
var tail = [2, 3, 4]
print [1 | tail]              # [1, 2, 3, 4]

var xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print [x * 2 | x <- xs]       # [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

Both forms share the same `[expr |` opening syntax and are told apart by
lookahead on the token immediately after `|`: a generator marker `<-`
means a list comprehension (`[expr | name <- source]`, evaluating `expr`
once per element of `source` with `name` bound to it, collecting the
results into a new vector); anything else means **cons**
(`[item | list]`, producing a new vector with `item` prepended onto a
copy of `list`).

**New for `0.3`: multiple generators and a guard clause.** Comma-separate
more `name <- source` clauses for a Cartesian product (desugars to nested
loops, the first-written generator outermost), and optionally follow the
generator list with a **second** `|` and a guard expression:

```
print [[x, y] | x <- [1, 2], y <- ["a", "b"]]   # [[1, 'a'], [1, 'b'], [2, 'a'], [2, 'b']]
print [n | n <- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] | n % 2 == 0] # [2, 4, 6]
```

A later generator's source expression may reference an earlier
generator's bound name — it's re-evaluated fresh on every iteration of
the outer loop(s), not just once up front:

```
fun upTo(n) { var r = []; for (var i mut = 0; i < n; ++i) { push r, i; } return r; }
print [[x, y] | x <- [1, 2, 3], y <- upTo(x)]
# [[1, 0], [2, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
```

The guard is just an ordinary boolean expression (`==`, `!=`, `and`,
`or`, `!`, ...) — there's no dedicated filter-clause syntax beyond the
second `|`, and it sees every generator's bound name already in scope.
The bound name in each generator clause is a single identifier, not a
destructuring pattern.

Both forms desugar entirely at compile time into ordinary (nested, for a
multi-generator comprehension) loops inside a synthetic closure — there
is no dedicated cons/comprehension runtime representation, just the two
VM opcodes (`VectorLength`, `VectorAppend`) that closure's loop body
compiles down to, plus a conditional (compiled exactly like any other
ternary) around the append when a guard is present.

### Vector-literal spread

```
var a = [1, 2]
var b = [4, 5]
print [...a, ...b]              # [1, 2, 4, 5]
print [0, ...a, 2.5, ...b, 5]   # [0, 1, 2, 2.5, 4, 5, 5]
```

`...expr` inside a plain, comma-separated vector literal splices every
element of `expr` (which must itself be a vector) into the result in
place, and can be freely mixed with ordinary items in any order. Spread
only applies inside this comma-separated literal form — it does not
combine with cons or comprehension syntax (`[...a | b]` isn't meaningful
under `0.2`'s scope for this feature).

## 10. The pipe operator

`a |> f` desugars, entirely at parse time, to the call `f(a)` — there's
no separate runtime representation for a pipe at all, it's just sugar for
a call written in the other order. It chains left-associatively:

```
fun square(n) { return n * n; }
5 |> square |> print   # prints 25, equivalent to print(square(5))
```

The right-hand side of `|>` must be a bare function name (a variable
reference) — `a |> 1` is a compile-time parse error, since `1` isn't
something that can be called.

## 11. Classes and objects

```
class Duck {
    var name
    var species pub

    init(name, species) {
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
    }

    pub quack() {
        print self.name
    }
}

var duck = Duck "Waddles", "Mallard"   # calling the class constructs an instance
duck.quack()                            # Waddles
print duck.species                      # Mallard
```

- **`self`**, not `this`, is the self-reference keyword.
- A class with no `init` method has arity zero (`Math()`, no arguments).
  A class's construction arity is always derived from its `init`
  method's arity.

### Properties: declaration, visibility, and mutability

**New for `0.2`.** `0.1` let a method assign `self.x = ...` to any name
at all, springing the field into existence on first assignment, with no
declaration and no immutability concept. `0.2` requires every property a
class uses to be **declared** in the class body, with two independent
modifiers:

```
class Duck {
    var name              # private, immutable -- set once, from init
    var energy mut        # private, mutable -- self only
    var species pub       # public, immutable -- readable from outside
    var quacking pub mut  # public, mutable -- readable and writable from outside
    ...
}
```

- **`pub`** controls **external** visibility: whether code *outside* the
  class (`duck.species`) can even see the property exists. Without
  `pub`, an external read or write is a runtime error.
- **`mut`** controls **mutability**: without it, a property may be
  assigned at most once (a second assignment is a runtime error, the
  same `undef`-sentinel write-once mechanism [§4](#4-variables-and-mutability)
  describes); with it, a property may be freely reassigned.
- These two axes are independent and combine as all four
  `pub`/`mut` presence combinations — private+immutable (the default,
  neither modifier), private+mutable, public+immutable, public+mutable.
- A property declaration takes **no initializer expression** — `var x
  pub = value` is not valid syntax. A property's actual value comes from
  whatever assignment (typically inside `init`) happens to run first.

Property declarations have no initializer syntax, and there's no
getter/setter accessor-body concept either — `pub`/`mut` replace that
category of feature entirely for `0.2`'s scope (no custom get/set logic,
no computed properties).

### Methods: visibility

**New for `0.2`.** A method is declared `pub method(...)  { ... }` or
just `method(...) { ... }` (private, the default):

```
class Vault {
    var contents mut

    init() { self.contents = 0 }

    checkPin(pin) { return pin == 1234; }   # private -- self-only

    pub deposit(amount, pin) {
        self.checkPin pin ? self.contents = self.contents + amount : print "Wrong PIN."
    }

    pub balance() { return self.contents; }
}

var vault = Vault()
vault.deposit 100, 1234
print vault.balance()     # 100
# vault.checkPin 1234     # runtime error -- checkPin has no pub
```

`init` is **always** externally callable regardless of any `pub`
annotation (or lack of one) — the visibility system never blocks
constructing an instance.

### Internal vs. external access, and protected-like subclassing

The property/method visibility rules above apply only to **external**
access — code reaching a member through some other expression
(`vault.checkPin`, `duck.species`). **Internal** access — a method
reading or calling `self.x`/`self.method()` on itself — always bypasses
every `pub`/`mut` gate; this is purely syntactic (is the access written
as exactly `self.x`, not "does this code happen to be inside the same
class"), which is what gives Iqalox a **protected-like** access model for
free: a subclass's own method calling `self.inheritedPrivateMethod()`
counts as internal access relative to *that* method's own body, the same
as C++/Java/C#'s `protected` — not stricter, and with zero extra
bookkeeping needed to support it.

```
class LoggingVault extends Vault {
    pub depositLogged(amount, pin) {
        self.checkPin pin ? print "PIN accepted." : print "PIN rejected."
        self.deposit amount, pin
    }
}

var logging = LoggingVault()
logging.depositLogged 50, 1234   # reaches Vault's private checkPin fine
```

### Inheritance

**Single inheritance** via `extends`. The VM copies the superclass's
whole method table into the subclass once, at `extends`-time (`ObjClass`'s
`methods` map) — Iqalox has no syntax for adding methods to a class after
it's declared, so there's no need for a live pointer-chain walk instead:

```
class A { pub greet() { print "A"; } }
class B extends A { }
B().greet()   # A -- B has no override, inherits A's
```

- **`super.method()`** calls up to the superclass method, resolved
  **lexically** — i.e. relative to the class the calling method is
  *written in*, not the actual runtime class of the calling instance. A
  three-level hierarchy where only the middle class overrides and calls
  `super` demonstrates this: the grandchild still ends up invoking the
  grandparent's method through the middle class's `super` call,
  regardless of which subclass instance it's called on. Ordinary
  (non-`super`) method calls, in contrast, dispatch dynamically against
  the receiver's actual runtime class — so an inherited method calling
  `self.method()` correctly reaches a subclass's override.
- **Extending a non-class value** (`class B extends NotAClass { }` where
  `NotAClass` isn't a class) is a runtime error, checked when the `class`
  statement executes.
- A class can reference itself by name from inside its own methods — the
  resolver defines the class's own name in scope before resolving its
  methods, so a method can look itself, or another instance of the same
  class, up by name.
- A subclass **redeclaring** a property already declared by an ancestor
  is a compile-time error — properties have no override semantics
  (methods do; see [§12](#12-mixins-and-traits) for how this extends to
  `with`-mixed-in and `use`-traited members too).
- Printing a class value itself shows `<class Duck>`; printing an
  instance shows `<Duck instance>`.

## 12. Mixins and traits

**New for `0.2`.** Beyond single inheritance, a class can compose members
from other sources two different ways, split by keyword: **traits**
(`trait`/`use`) and **mixins** (`with`). They look similar on the surface
but work completely differently underneath, and that difference is
deliberate and visible.

### Traits (`trait`/`use`): compile-time static copying

```
trait Flyable {
    pub fly() { print "Flying!"; }
}

trait Swimmable {
    pub swim() { print "Swimming!"; }
}

class Duck {
    use Flyable, Swimmable

    pub quack() { print "Quack!"; }
}

var duck = Duck()
duck.fly()    # Flying!
duck.swim()   # Swimming!
duck.quack()  # Quack!
```

A `trait` is grammared like a class body (properties, methods, and even
nested `use` of other traits) but has **zero runtime representation** —
`use Flyable, Swimmable` statically inlines the named traits' members
into `Duck` entirely at **compile time** (`compiler/src/Resolver.fs`),
the same way PHP's `trait`/`use` works. A trait-provided method's `self`
and `super` resolve relative to the *using* class, not the trait itself.
Because a trait never exists at runtime, it can never be the target of
`extends` or `with` — only a real class can be mixed in that way (see
below).

### Mixins (`with`): runtime composition

```
class Named {
    pub greet() { print "Hello!"; }
}

class Robot with Named {
    pub beep() { print "Beep boop."; }
}

var robot = Robot()
robot.greet()   # Hello!
robot.beep()    # Beep boop.
```

`with` composes a **real, independently-instantiable class**'s already-
compiled methods and properties into the composing class at **runtime**,
via a dedicated `Mixin` opcode (mirroring how `extends`/`Inherit` copies
a superclass's members in, except the mixin's own value is discarded
afterward — it's never needed again). `with` can combine with `extends`
on the same class:

```
class Vehicle { pub honk() { print "Honk!"; } }
class Winged { pub fly() { print "Zoom!"; } }

class FlyingCar extends Vehicle with Winged {
    pub drive() { print "Driving."; }
}

var car = FlyingCar()
car.honk()    # Honk!
car.fly()     # Zoom!
car.drive()   # Driving.
```

`0.2` ships a **simplified, non-C3-linearized** composition algorithm for
`with` — multiple mixins compose independently rather than through a
full C3 method-resolution-order chain, and `super` does **not** chain
through a `with`-mixin the way it does through `extends`. A full
Scala-style linearization is deliberately deferred; see `ROADMAP.md`'s
"Language feature ideas under consideration" for the reasoning.

### Conflict resolution

Two composed sources — two used traits, a used trait and the class's own
superclass, two `with`-mixins, or a mixin and the superclass — sharing a
member name is a **compile-time error**. There is no `insteadof`/`as`-style
disambiguation syntax (PHP has one; `0.2`'s grammar doesn't); the only
ways out are renaming one of the conflicting members, or declaring the
member directly on the composing class, which **always silently wins**
over anything composed in:

- For **methods**, the composing class's own literal declaration
  overriding a composed one is ordinary polymorphism — no error, no
  special syntax needed.
- For **properties**, redeclaring one already provided by a composed
  source is **still a compile-time error** — properties have no override
  semantics at all (see [§11](#11-classes-and-objects)), so "the class's
  own body wins" doesn't extend to silently accepting a property
  redeclaration the way it does for methods.

```
trait A { pub greet() { print "A"; } }
trait B { pub greet() { print "B"; } }

class C {
    use A, B   # compile-time error: 'greet' is provided by both A and B
}
```

## 13. The standard library

`0.2` has a substantially larger standard library than `0.1`'s two
functions, all registered as ordinary (shadowable, non-keyword) global
bindings — there is no reserved-word status protecting any of these
names, and shadowing one (`var length = ...`) at the top level is a
compile-time error (redeclaring an existing global) exactly like
redeclaring any other global; shadowing inside a nested scope is fine.

### Core

- **`print value`** — stringifies `value` (see [§3](#3-values-and-types)'s
  stringification rules: `nil` → `nil`, floats drop a trailing `.0`,
  booleans lowercase) and writes it followed by a newline. Returns `nil`.
- **`concat vector`** — stringifies every element of `vector` and joins
  them with no separator, returning the resulting string. This is
  currently the *only* way to build a string from non-string values or to
  join strings together, since `+` doesn't work on strings
  ([§3](#3-values-and-types)). A non-vector argument is a runtime error.

```
concat ["a", 1, "b"]   # "a1b"
```

### Array manipulation

`push`, `pop`, `length`, and `reverse` are true natives
(`vm/src/natives.cpp`) — they operate directly on an `ObjVector`'s
storage and never call back into user code:

- **`push vector, value`** — appends `value` to `vector` **in place**.
  Returns `nil`.
- **`pop vector`** — removes and returns the last element of `vector`
  **in place**. A runtime error on an empty vector.
- **`length vector`** — returns the element count as a number.
- **`reverse vector`** — returns a **new** vector with elements in
  reverse order; does not mutate the original.

`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `sort` are not natives — they're ordinary
Iqalox `fun` declarations (`compiler/src/Prelude.fs`), textually
prepended to every program's source before it's compiled, using the same
paren-free call syntax and lambda syntax any user program has. They take
a lambda as their first argument and never mutate their vector
argument(s):

- **`map fn, vector`** — returns a new vector of `fn(element)` applied to
  each element.
- **`filter fn, vector`** — returns a new vector of only the elements for
  which `fn(element)` is truthy.
- **`reduce fn, vector, initial`** — folds `vector` left-to-right via
  `acc = fn(acc, element)`, starting from `initial`, returning the final
  accumulator.
- **`sort fn, vector`** — returns a new, sorted vector; `fn(a, b)` should
  return truthy when `a` belongs before `b` (e.g. `(a, b) -> a < b` for
  ascending, `(a, b) -> a > b` for descending).

```
var v = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
print (map (x) -> x * 2, v)              # [6, 2, 8, 2, 10]
print (filter (x) -> x % 2 == 0, v)      # [4]
print (reduce (a, b) -> a + b, v, 0)     # 14
print (sort (a, b) -> a < b, v)          # [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Matrix manipulation

A matrix is a vector of vectors, indexed one level at a time (see
[§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread)). `transpose`,
`multiply`, `add`, and `subtract` are true natives that validate their
argument(s) are a genuinely **rectangular** matrix (every row the same
length) and raise a dedicated, clearly-worded runtime error on a shape
mismatch (e.g. multiplying a 2x3 by a 4x2 matrix):

- **`transpose matrix`** — returns a new MxN → NxM transposed matrix.
- **`multiply a, b`** — matrix product; `a`'s column count must equal
  `b`'s row count.
- **`add a, b`** / **`subtract a, b`** — elementwise sum/difference;
  `a` and `b` must be the same shape.

`elementwise fn, a, b` is, like `map`/`filter`/`reduce`/`sort`, ordinary
Iqalox source (`compiler/src/Prelude.fs`) rather than a native — it
applies `fn(a[i][j], b[i][j])` across every position and returns the
resulting matrix, but **deliberately does not validate** that `a` and `b`
are the same shape the way the four natives above do: since there's no
`try`/`throw` construct for Prelude-level Iqalox code to raise a
dedicated error with, a shape mismatch here just falls through to the
ordinary "vector index out of range" error a step later — a real,
non-crashing runtime error either way, just not a custom-worded one.

```
var a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
var b = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

print transpose a                        # [[1, 3], [2, 4]]
print multiply a, b                      # [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
print add a, b                           # [[6, 8], [10, 12]]
print subtract a, b                      # [[-4, -4], [-4, -4]]
print elementwise (x, y) -> x * y, a, b  # [[5, 12], [21, 32]]
```

Everything else commonly found in a language's standard library — string
manipulation beyond `concat`, math beyond the operators in
[§5](#5-operators-and-precedence), I/O, collections beyond vectors — is
**not implemented yet**; see `ROADMAP.md`'s "Standard library vision"
section for what's planned and roughly when.

## 14. Errors

Iqalox distinguishes two error phases, both of which currently **abort
the whole program** — there is no way for Iqalox source code to catch or
recover from either kind:

- **Compile-time errors** — scan errors (e.g. an unterminated string, an
  invalid escape sequence, an unexpected character), parse errors (e.g. a
  malformed ternary), resolve errors (e.g. reassigning an immutable
  variable, using `super` outside a subclass, an undeclared property, a
  trait/mixin member conflict), and codegen errors (e.g. `break` outside
  a loop). `iqaloxc` reports each as `[line N] Error: message` to stderr
  and exits with status `65`. Compilation never reaches the VM at all if
  any stage reports an error.
- **Runtime errors** — e.g. wrong arity, dividing by zero, a non-number
  operand to an arithmetic/comparison operator, an undefined
  variable/property, reading a `var mut` (or non-`mut` property) before
  its first assignment, reassigning a non-`mut` property a second time,
  an out-of-range vector index, extending/mixing-in a non-class,
  external access to a non-`pub` member, calling a non-callable value.
  `iqaloxvm` reports the message plus `[line N]` to stderr and exits with
  status `70`, after whatever output was already produced. The line
  comes from a per-instruction-byte line table the bytecode format
  carries alongside the instructions themselves — every emitted
  instruction is stamped with whichever source token `Codegen.fs` most
  recently had in view, the same way `clox` stamps every byte it emits
  with the parser's current line.

**Remaining, smaller gap versus `0.1-poc`**: `0.1-poc` additionally shows
*which token* triggered the error (`Error at 'x': ...`) plus a caret-
underlined source excerpt, for both compile-time and runtime errors.
`0.2` has real line numbers for both, but not yet the token text or
source excerpt — the VM in particular has no access to the original
source text at all (it only ever receives a compiled `.iqbc` file), so
reproducing `0.1-poc`'s excerpt there would need embedding source text in
the bytecode format, not just a line table. See
[§15](#15-known-limitations) item 8.

There is no `try`/`catch`/`throw` construct in the language itself.

## 15. Known limitations

These are documented tradeoffs and open items, not undiscovered bugs —
see `docs/PLAN-0.2.md`, `docs/PLAN-0.1.md`, and `docs/PLAN-0.1-POC.md`
for the full history of how each was arrived at.

1. **No string concatenation via `+`.** `"a" + "b"` is a runtime error
   (arithmetic `+` requires both operands to be numbers); use `concat
   ["a", "b"]` instead.
2. **Chaining `.method()` straight onto a call that itself takes an
   argument is ambiguous, and currently binds to the argument, not the
   outer call.** `B "Bea".greet()` parses as `B(("Bea").greet())`, not
   `(B("Bea")).greet()` — there's no parenthesis marking where a
   paren-free call's argument list ends, unlike Lox's `f(x).y`. The same
   ambiguity applies to indexing: `f x[0]` binds `[0]` to `x`, not to
   `f`'s result. Workaround: bind the call's result to a variable first,
   or wrap the whole call in its own grouping parens (`(B "Bea").greet()`).
3. **No built-in methods on primitive values.** Numbers, strings, and
   booleans have no methods of their own (`"hi".length()` doesn't
   exist); vectors gain real standard-library functions in `0.2`
   ([§13](#13-the-standard-library)), but as ordinary global functions,
   not vector *methods* — `v.length()` still doesn't exist, only
   `length v`.
4. **No concurrency, no exception handling, no reflection/metaprogramming**
   exist at the language level (see [§1](#1-introduction-and-classification)).
5. **`with`-mixin composition is simplified, not full C3 linearization.**
   Multiple mixins compose independently rather than through a real
   method-resolution-order chain, and `super` doesn't chain through a
   `with`-mixin the way it does through `extends`. Deferred deliberately
   (see [§12](#12-mixins-and-traits)); a full C3 algorithm is logged in
   `ROADMAP.md` as a future idea, not committed scope.
6. **No trait member-conflict disambiguation syntax.** PHP's `insteadof`/
   `as` have no equivalent here — a conflict between two composed sources
   is always a hard compile-time error; the only ways out are renaming or
   redeclaring the member directly on the composing class
   ([§12](#12-mixins-and-traits)).
7. **No token text or source excerpt on errors, unlike `0.1-poc`.**
   `0.1-poc` reports both compile-time and runtime errors as `[line N]
   Error at 'x': message` plus a caret-underlined single-line source
   excerpt. `0.2` reports a real `[line N]` for every error kind
   (including runtime errors, via a per-instruction-byte line table in
   the bytecode format itself), but not yet the offending token's text or
   a source excerpt. The excerpt/token-text part remains open, and for
   the VM specifically would need embedding source text in the bytecode
   format (it only ever receives a compiled `.iqbc` file, never the
   original source), not just a line table.
8. **A vector literal or grouping expression can't span multiple lines.**
   The scanner turns *every* newline into an implicit `;`
   unconditionally, with no awareness of bracket/paren depth — so
   `print (\n1 + 2\n)` or a `[...]` literal split across lines both fail
   with `Expect expression.` at the line following the opening bracket,
   the newline having already terminated the "statement" right after it.
   Not fixed here — making the scanner bracket-depth-aware is a real
   scanner change with its own test surface.
9. **A non-identifier callee can't be called at all, with or without
   parentheses.** The "am I followed by something that looks like an
   argument" check only ever runs for a bare `IDENTIFIER` (or,
   indirectly, a property/method access), so a grouped expression never
   gets that treatment — neither `(f) 5` nor even `(f)()` parses; the
   callee has to be bound to a name first. This makes an
   immediately-invoked lambda expression currently inexpressible: `((x)
   -> x + 1) 5` doesn't parse, even though `(x) -> x + 1` is a perfectly
   valid lambda value once bound to a variable.
10. **A one-line block whose last statement is a bare `return <value>`
    needs an explicit trailing `;` before the closing `}`.** ASI only
    ever fires on an actual newline, so `fun f(x) { return x }`
    (everything on one line) fails to parse — the closing `}` doesn't
    itself imply a statement terminator. Writing the body across multiple
    lines (or an explicit `; }`) works fine. Not fixed here — a real
    scanner change (teaching ASI that `}` also implies a terminator,
    mirroring how many C-like languages' "automatic semicolon insertion"
    rules work) with its own test surface.
11. **A runtime error raised from inside a `map`/`filter`/`reduce`/`sort`/
    `elementwise` prelude function reports a `[line N]` relative to the
    prelude's own source text, not the user's file.** `Program.fs` scans
    and parses `Prelude.fs`'s embedded source separately from the user's
    own, purely so a failure in each can be attributed correctly at
    *compile* time — but once both are merged into one program and
    compiled to one `Chunk`, a *runtime* fault raised from inside a
    prelude function's own closure body carries that function's own
    internal line number (1-based within `Prelude.fs`'s `source`
    string), with nothing to indicate it came from a different "file"
    than the one the user is looking at. Not solved here — nothing in
    this pipeline has ever needed multi-file source-position tracking
    before now.
12. **`elementwise`'s shape-mismatch behavior is generic, not
    dedicated.** Unlike `transpose`/`multiply`/`add`/`subtract` (true
    natives with clean, custom-worded shape-validation errors),
    `elementwise` is ordinary Iqalox source with no `throw`/`raise`
    construct available to it — a shape mismatch surfaces as the
    ordinary "vector index out of range" error a step later, not a
    dedicated shape-mismatch message. See [§13](#13-the-standard-library).

The following limitations from earlier versions are **resolved**:
vectors being literal-only with no indexing/mutation/length (now fixed as
of `0.2`, see `docs/LANGUAGE-0.1.md` §13 for the original write-up;
[§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread),
[§13](#13-the-standard-library)), object fields having no immutability or
declaration concept at all (now fixed as of `0.2`, `docs/LANGUAGE-0.1.md`
§13; [§11](#11-classes-and-objects) — properties must be declared and
default to write-once), and list comprehensions supporting only a single
generator with no guard clause (now fixed as of `0.3`, see
`docs/LANGUAGE-0.2.md` §15 once it exists for the original write-up;
[§9](#9-vectors-indexing-cons-comprehensions-and-spread) covers the
multi-generator/guarded form).

## 16. Grammar and precedence reference

The authoritative, up-to-date grammar lives in
`langspec/SYNTAX_GRAMMAR.md`; the precedence table (same information,
presented tightest-to-loosest) is in the root `README.md`. Both describe
the language independent of any one implementation — refer to those files
directly rather than duplicating them here, since a third copy would only
be one more place for the three to drift out of sync.
